<b>Grid Generation Tools</b></h1></center>
<font size="+1">Unstructured grid generation can mesh any geometry. One of
the design criteria for the two tools presented on this page was <i>minimum
user input</i>, ie. the user should have as little information to specify
as possible. This has been acheived on two levels: the geometry is specified
by defining a curve analytically or discretely and by a few points with
grid spacing along the segments. The grid can then be created using just
these surface points.</font>

<h2>
Curve Discretization with <tt>ipol</tt></h2></center>
I<font size="+1">pol allows to distribute points on analytic or discrete
curves by specifiying point distances at various locations along the curve.
A script language takes the curve parameters and program options. Input
and output of the discretized point chains on the curves are in a .pts
format as used by the triangular mesher.</font>

<h3>
Delaunay Triangulation with <tt><font size="+2">delaundo</font></tt></h3></center>
<font size="+1">Delaundo creates triangular grids based on the Frontal Delaunay
Method (Frod). First the set of discretized curves that describe the boundary
is triangulated. This initial mesh is suitable for interpolation of a local
mesh size throughout the domain after a few modifications in the connections
are made by the algorithm. New internal vertices are then created on frontal
edges between well-shaped and ill-shaped triangles such that a new triangle
with the desired size and a good shape will result.</font>

<p><font size="+1">Thus, the algorithm is similar to the various Delaunay
methods in that the resulting triangulation observes a circum-circle criterion.
It is also akin to Advancing Front methods in that new vertices are introduced
in layers on the boundaries in a very regular fashion. The regularity of
the point distribution and thus the element quality is enhanced by an averaging
process that tends to choose an equilibrium position between competing
edges when the front is refined or coarsenend.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">Delaundo can produce stretched grids and has a multi-grid
capability that produces a serios of coarsened grid with nested nodes.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">A few examples. A straightforward triangulation of the
simple NACA 0012 airfoil with the boundary points from above produces the
following grid:</font>

</p><p><img src="delaundo_files/large0012.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" border="2" height="592" width="594" align="middle">

</p><p><img src="delaundo_files/small0012.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" border="2" height="592" width="594" align="middle">

</p><p><font size="+1">Delaundo has also a rudimentary capability to create grids
with stretched layers for viscous calculations that works well for moderate
stretching factors of up to 100. Due to the simple implementation the stretched
layers must completely wrap around a simply connected body such as an airfoil
with a wake. It cannot do bump-like cases, where non-stretched boundaries
are attached to stretched ones. The following example shows the grid around
a three-element airfoil with a stretching of 1:10.</font>
